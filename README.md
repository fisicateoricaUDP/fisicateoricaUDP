- 👋 Hi, we are the group @fisicateoricaUDP from Pamplona University - Colombia.
- 👀 We are interested in developing software for High Energy Physics. 
- 🌱 We are currently working in the computation of radiative corrections to the Higgs observables in the SM/MSSM, 
-  with the help of several specialized packages in Wolfram Mathemtica, FORM, Python, etc. 
- 💞️ Any comment, suggestion and/or collaboration is very welcome. 
- 📫 You can reach us through the emails: eareyesro@unal.edu.co, edilson.reyes@unipamplona.edu.co.
